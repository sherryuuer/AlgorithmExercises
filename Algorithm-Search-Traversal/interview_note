//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS
right

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
DFS!not right
answer:
BFS (DFS will take long.)

//If the tree is very wide:
BFS!not right
answer:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory.)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS
right,save the memory and be quick.

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
BFS!not right
DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
DFS!not right
BFS
